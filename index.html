<h1>The Day We Met</h1>
<p>
We met at work when I was asked to train you.
I fell for you instantly, even though you didn’t like my vibe at first 😅
I kept pushing, and one day it worked.
The day you left, we went home together —
and that’s when everything clicked.

<h2>Our First Date</h2>
<p>
We went bowling, did a little shopping, and explored together.
I was excited and nervous at first, but it turned into such a fun day.
We laughed, enjoyed every moment, and you completely surprised me — especially at bowling 😍
That day will always stay with me.

<h2>Our Ups and Downs</h2>
<p>
Do you still remember our first big argument?
We fought about politics — Raila vs Ruto 😅
You were team Ruto, I was team Raila, and we were both stubborn.
We even slept mad and continued the argument kidogo the next morning.
But we talked it out… and love won 🤍

<h2>Just Between Us</h2>
<p>
Do you remember how we’d keep gossiping about people everywhere we went, especially at events? 😂
Always giving tea, always whispering, until you’d laugh and say,
“Ntakuja kupigwa one day, aki sisi.” 🤍

<h2>Inside Jokes</h2>
<p>
We both love to joke around. Our little inside jokes make me smile when I remember them even when we are not together.
• Unakumba what has happed na ule makanga wa Hii ni nini
I’m sure our unique humor makes our bond stronger.

<h2>My Favorite Melody for Us</h2>
<p>
When we asked each other what song we would like to be played on our wedding day,
we both said the same thing.
(A Thousand Years – Christina Perri & Beautiful in White – Shane Filan)
We’re going to make sure it will be played when I walk down the aisle.
